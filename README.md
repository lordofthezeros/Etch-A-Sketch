# Etch-A-Sketch

This project is a riff on the classic etch-a-sketch game, as well as a variation on pixel art

I have learnt a lot from this project and whilst this is nowhere near as polished as I would like it to be, I know that I will be able to polish this from a CSS standpoint fairly easily and this was more about me learning to use JavaScript within a project instead of static websites.

I will revisit this shortly and update this README, however for now I am going to move on with my course as I do not need this to be completely slick right now
